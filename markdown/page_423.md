For example, if one wanted to filter all duplicates from the data stream, the bloom filter is an effective strategy. Another strategy is to filter forbidden elements from a universe of values, such as a set of spammer e-mail addresses in an e-mail stream. In such a case, the bloom filter needs to be constructed up front with the spam e-mail addresses.

Many variations of the basic bloom filter strategy provide different capabilities and trade-offs:

1. The bloom filter can be used to approximate the number of distinct elements in a data stream. If $m_0 < m$ is the number of bits with a value of 0 in the bloom filter, then the number of distinct elements $n$ can be estimated as follows (see Exercise 13):

$$
n \approx \frac{m}{w} \cdot \ln(m/m_0)
$$

(12.21)

The accuracy of this estimate reduces drastically, as the bloom filter fills up. When $m_0 = 0$, the value of $n$ is estimated to be $\infty$, and therefore the estimate is practically useless.

2. The bloom filter can be used to estimate the size of the intersection and union of sets corresponding to different streams, by creating one bloom filter for each stream. To determine the size of the union, the bitwise OR of the two filters is determined. The bitwise OR of the filter can be shown to be exactly the same as the bloom filter representation of the union of the two sets. Then, the formula of Eq. 12.21 is used. However, such an approach cannot be used for determining the size of the intersection. While the intersection of two sets can be approximated by using a bitwise AND operation on the two filters, the resulting bit positions in the filter will not be the same as that obtained by constructing the filter directly on the intersection. The resulting filter might contain false negatives, and, therefore, such an approach is lossy. To estimate the size of the intersection, one can first estimate the size of the union and then use the following simple setwise relationship:

$$
|S_1 \cap S_2| = |S_1| + |S_2| - |S_1 \cup S_2|
$$

(12.22)

3. The bloom filter is primarily designed for membership queries, and is not the most space-efficient data structure, when used purely for distinct element counting. In a later section, a space-efficient technique, referred to as the Flajoletâ€“Martin algorithm, will be discussed.

4. The bloom filter can allow a limited (one-time) tracking of deletions by setting the corresponding bit elements to zero, when an element is deleted. In such a case, false negatives are also possible.

5. Variants of the bloom filter can be designed in which the $u$ hash functions can map onto separate bit arrays. A further generalization of this principle is to track counts of elements rather than simply binary bit values to enable richer queries. This generalization, discussed in the next section, is also referred to as the count-min sketch.

Bloom filters are commonly used in many streaming settings in the text domain.
