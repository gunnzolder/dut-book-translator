Text data are copiously found in many domains, such as the Web, social networks, newswire services, and libraries. With the increasing ease in archival of human speech and expression, the volume of text data will only increase over time. This trend is reinforced by the increasing digitization of libraries and the ubiquity of the Web and social networks. Some examples of relevant domains are as follows:

This has led to the proliferation of digital libraries in which effective document management becomes crucial. Furthermore, mining tools are also used in some domains, such as biomedical literature, to glean useful insights.

2. Web and Web-enabled applications: The Web is a vast repository of documents that is further enriched with links and other types of side information. Web documents are also referred to as hypertext. The additional side information available with hypertext can be useful in the knowledge discovery process. In addition, many web-enabled applications, such as social networks, chat boards, and bulletin boards, are a significant source of text for analysis.

3. Newswire services: An increasing trend in recent years has been the de-emphasis of printed newspapers and a move toward electronic news dissemination. This trend creates a massive stream of news documents that can be analyzed for important events and insights.

The set of features (or dimensions) of text is also referred to as its lexicon. A collection of documents is referred to as a corpus. A document can be viewed as either a sequence, or a multidimensional record. A text document is, after all, a discrete sequence of words, also
